If your server's IP is listed on here you have been blocked from using this mod (for a specific reason see corresponding file).

The most common reasons for landing on this list are [repacking](https://github.com/PhilippVidal/MoreExplosives/wiki/FAQ#can-i-repack-this-mod) the mod without permission or not following the [monetization rules](https://github.com/PhilippVidal/MoreExplosives/wiki/Monetization-and-Usage).

Being blocked from using this mod does not break your server in any way (i.e., there is no crashing or malicious code being executed), players will receive a UI pop-up informing them the server has been blacklisted and will be disconnected.

Blacklisted servers can appeal the ban on the mod's [discord](https://discord.gg/ZC7NsZ9) in the appropriate channel.
