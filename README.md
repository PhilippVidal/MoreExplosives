More Explosives is a mod for DayZ that adds several new types of explosives. 
These explosives can be remote detonated or triggered through the use of a timer. 
In addition to this, the mod offers a similar raiding experience to the [Breachingcharge mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1827241477).

Explosives have to be combined with a triggering device (e.g., a timer or receiver) to be useful.
Once an appropriate trigger has been attached, the explosive can be armed (i.e., connected to the attached trigger), this locks the trigger to the explosive and enables the explosive to detonate.  
Additionally, an armed explosive can also be mounted on a surface to lock it into place, requiring a player to dismount it in order to pick it up again. 

When using a timer as a trigger, the player can adjust the countdown between a min and max value and start the timer. 
When using a receiver as the trigger, the player has to connect the receiver to a detonator. 
Detonators can be connected to multiple receivers and have several different modes that allow the player to select a single explosive or detonate all connected explosives at once. 

The explosives make use of DayZ's damage system to damage most items in the game, but apply damage differently to base building objects in order to allow for greater configuration when it comes to base raiding. 

Several aspects of these items can be [configured](https://github.com/PhilippVidal/MoreExplosives/wiki/Configuration) to fit a server and their intended usage.
