This is an example config override for the More Explosive mod that makes several changes to the general mod settings as well as a handful of item paramters: 

General Settings: 
- Only objects with doors can be raided 
- Locks will get deleted after they get detached 
- Only MOE explosives can be used to damage base building objects 
- Raid schedule is enabled (UTC+1, every friday from noon till midnight)

Ammo/Explosion Settings: 
- Damage range for the military explosive increased to 14 meters, full damage range to 7 meters
- Damage increase (against base building objects) to 5000

Item Settings: 
- Military explosive: 60 seconds to arm, has to be mounted, can attach homemade timer & receiver in addition to the military variants 
- Homemade & military timers now have a static time (120s & 90s). This makes it so that they can not be configured anymore by the player since their min. timer and max. timer are the same.
